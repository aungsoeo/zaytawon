The slideshow stacks all of the elements on top of each other and uses modern transitions to fade 
the individual elements in and out. These techniques are not compatible with IE9 and below.

Using a conditional comment that can only be read by IE, we tell IE to load this CSS file. This 
file tells the slideshow to show all of the elements. As they are stacked on top of each other 
only the last element will be visible
